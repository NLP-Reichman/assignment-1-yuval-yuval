# Assignment 1 

## Your Implementation
Please create a local copy of [this template Colab's Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Py-fh9G4R5NruLc55T-diLOWE0xRvzXH?usp=sharing).

The assignment's instructions are there; follow the notebook.

## Testing
Copy the content of the *tests.py* file (as is) to the designated code cell in the notebook and run it.
It will produce and download the *results.json* file with the results of the tests.
Please replace the existing results file of this repo with your current one!

## Submission
Please place a link to your assignment's notebook under *notebook_link.txt*.
Please place a link with **edit** permission so we can run your code.
Place only the link; see the example in the file.

## General instructions
Please commit and push only the **results.json** and **notebook_link.txt** files. Please avoid changing/deleting files under the .github folder, as this may interfere with the auto-grading operation.

GOOD LUCK! ðŸ¤—
